Files related to my Database Clinic: MySQL course for LinkedIn Learning

The point of the Database Clinic series is that a variety of instructors will try to accomplish the same database tasks - CRUD operations, mostly - with the same set of data files. In order to get access to those data files, you'll need to have a LinkedIn Learning membership and access any of the Database Clinic courses.
